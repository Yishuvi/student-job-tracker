AI Tools Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI), GitHub Copilot

How I Used Them:

1. ChatGPT:
- Helped with planning full-stack structure (frontend + backend)
- Debugged deployment issues on Vercel and Render
- Suggested DSA problem solution for job sorting
- Guided me step-by-step on folder structure, form handling, and code organization

2. GitHub Copilot:
- Assisted with writing repetitive JSX and API logic
- Suggested cleaner useEffect and axios patterns

How it Helped:
- Saved time during debugging
- Made backend setup faster (especially with Express/MongoDB)
- Helped me follow best practices
 Manual Changes I Made:
- Fixed import paths after file renaming
- Replaced `process.env` with `import.meta.env` for Vite compatibility
- Adjusted deployment configs for Render/Vercel
- Tweaked styles and layout from AI suggestions

Summary:
AI tools made the process faster, especially for debugging and learning new parts of the stack.
